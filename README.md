## 👋 About Me

Master in Financial Administration with 10 years of experience in financial roles and a certification from TripleTen’s Data Science Bootcamp, with a B2 English level. Specialized in Machine Learning, Python (Pandas, Scikit‑learn, NumPy), SQL, and visualization tools.

My background in management control and financial analysis has provided me with a solid understanding of business metrics, budgeting, KPIs, and strategic decision‑making processes. I combine technical data science skills with financial interpretation expertise, enabling me to develop predictive models that directly impact profitability and operational efficiency.

I am seeking an opportunity as a Financial Specialist where I can contribute my financial experience alongside the skills acquired in data science.
